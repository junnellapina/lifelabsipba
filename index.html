	<h2>What is the fundraising event all about?</h2>
	<p> Because of the recent problems of sitio bebe's community we thought that a fundraising event would help them to build their community back again. And now we brainstormed what is the best content type to use to promote the fundraising event to gain more funds to help the community of sitio bebe. We brainstormed what content to use, who are the target audiences, and what are the needs and requirements that we will use to create this type of content.

                <h3>Chosen Content(Gaming)</h3>
		<p>We chose this kind of content because it is much more flexible than other contents and we have prior knowledge about gaming. As the days pass more and more people play games, many of them will be interested in watching these types of videos. Our goal is to promote the fundraising event by persuading gamers that are interested to participate in the event. Gaming is one of the most watched content in various types of streaming services like youtube, twitch, facebook, etc. we can promote and persuade more people with this content.<p>

			<h4>Target audience (Gamers and others who are interested)</h4>
				<p>The audience for our content primarily targets anyone who is interested in gaming, but anyone can watch whether they are into gaming or not. We will strive to entertain the viewers, in hopes that they will be interested enough to attend the fundraiser concert.

			<h5>Needs (Youtube account, a pc/phone and a screen recorder)</h5>
				<p>Our need to make gaming content is a pc or a phone that can run a game, a screen recorder and a knowledge of Youtube and its features, and this is optional but we can use a webcam to interact closely with the viewer.
